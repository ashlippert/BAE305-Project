  <h1>Automated Blinds Project</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project was developed as part of a circuits course using the Scrum methodology. The goal was to design and build an automated blinds system that can raise, lower, and rotate the blinds manually or in response to ambient light levels. The system is powered by an Arduino and includes DC motors, a stepper motor, and a light sensor. While the remote-control functionality is not yet operational, the primary system modes are functional through programmed button inputs. This project provides a starting point for future development of smart, energy-conscious window blind systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Description</h2>
  <p>
    The system uses an Arduino Uno to control two DC motors via an L298N motor driver and a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor. Four operational modes are selected via push buttons connected to digital input pins. The stepper motor is used to rotate the blinds, while the DC motors control the raise/lower functions. A photoresistor detects ambient light, triggering blind adjustment when necessary. The wiring includes current-limiting resistors, pull-down resistors for input stability, and power is supplied via USB or external adapter.
  </p>

  <h2>Design and Build Process</h2>
  <p>
    The blinds cord was attached to a 3D printed spool with superglue, and this spool was connected to a DC motor at each end for controlling the blinds' vertical movement. The blinds themselves are mounted using a 3-prong over-the-door hook, with a hardboard backing for added stability. The Arduino, breadboards, and all circuitry outside of the stepper motor are securely mounted to the backing board using superglue and mounting tape. The stepper motor is attached to the blinds to enable rotation, allowing the blinds to turn based on the input received from the Arduino.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Arduino is connected to my laptop via USB for programming, but a backup battery supply is mounted to the board in case external power is needed. The system is controlled via three buttons mounted to a breadboard, which is also attached to the backing board. The <code>BAE305Project.ino</code> file is used to initialize the system and control the different operational modes by processing button presses and activating the motors.
  </p>

  <h2>Testing Description</h2>
  <p>
    The system was tested using a multimeter, oscilloscope (Tektronix TBS 1052B), and USB power supply. Buttons were individually tested for signal integrity, and motor response was verified in each mode. Light sensitivity was tested by varying light exposure to the photoresistor. Limitations in the testing arose from inconsistent motor power under battery use and occasional timing conflicts in mode switching.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Decision Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    Key design decisions included using separate control pins for each motor direction and dedicating a mode for light-based automation. We chose the L298N driver for its simplicity and compatibility with the Arduino. Stepper motor implementation required a custom rotation algorithm to achieve precise open/close angles. Future engineers may consider integrating wireless modules (e.g., ESP8266) and adding limit switches or encoders for better motor control and safety.
  </p>

  <h2>Test Results Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    The system successfully demonstrated mode-based motor control, with three manual modes functioning reliably. The photoresistor trigger mode functioned under controlled lighting but may require calibration in variable environments. Remote control connectivity remains incomplete and presents a development opportunity. Overall, the design works well for a simple proof-of-concept system but lacks robustness for long-term or commercial deployment without further development.
  </p>

  <h2>Testing Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>DC motors rotate blinds up and down correctly when buttons are pressed</li>
    <li>Stepper motor rotates 4x to tilt blinds open and closed</li>
    <li>Light sensor activates blind tilt when light drops below a set threshold</li>
    <li>All four modes operate as intended with clear visual feedback</li>
    <li>Remote control function not yet implemented</li>
  </ul>
