  <h1>Automated Blinds Control System</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This project aimed to design and prototype an automated window blind system capable of raising, lowering, and rotating based on manual input and ambient light levels. The intent was to improve energy efficiency and user convenience in home settings through automation. The blinds are controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, DC motors, and a stepper motor, with input from a light sensor. Although remote control functionality was intended, it is currently non-operational. This system demonstrates a functional prototype with manual override and automatic light response, serving as a foundational system for future improvements in smart home integration.</p>

  <h2>Design Description</h2>
  <p> 
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2x DC Motors (for lift/lower functions)
- 1x Stepper Motor (for tilting slats)
- Light Sensor (LDR or similar)
- Pushbuttons or switches (for manual control)
- Power source (e.g., 9V or 12V regulated)</p>
